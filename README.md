**Fast, reliable, and seamless online book delivery and library management.**

## 📖 Project Overview

**BiblioDrop** is a comprehensive digital platform bridging the gap between avid readers, local libraries, and independent book owners. Traditional library systems require physical visits, which can be a barrier for busy professionals or remote students. BiblioDrop democratizes access to books by enabling users to browse collections, request doorstep delivery, and manage their reading lists securely.

Librarians and book owners can seamlessly list their inventory, while an Admin oversees the entire ecosystem. The platform ensures a secure, streamlined borrowing experience with role-based access control, secure payment integration, and interactive features like verified reviews.
